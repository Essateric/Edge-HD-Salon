Thanks for uploading the video! I‚Äôve reviewed it and here's a detailed breakdown of how to **recreate the interface and functionality using React** along with **Tailwind CSS** (for fast and clean styling) and **Framer Motion** (for smooth animations):

### ‚úÖ **Prompt for Replit / React App**

> Build a modern, animated user interface using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** to replicate the style and functionality shown in the video.
>
> ### üìê Layout Requirements:
>
> 1. **Full-screen centered interface** with a dark gradient or blur background.
> 2. In the center, place a **chat-style assistant panel** with:
>    - A logo or image at the top (circular or animated).
>    - A greeting message from the assistant (e.g., "Hi, I‚Äôm Mia! How can I help you today?").
>    - A few **quick action buttons** (e.g., ‚ÄúMake a Booking‚Äù, ‚ÄúRearrange Appointment‚Äù) styled as pill-shaped buttons.
>
> 3. A **typing input box at the bottom**, fixed inside the panel, with:
>    - Placeholder text.
>    - A send icon/button on the right.
>
> 4. Optional: Add a subtle **floating animation** to the assistant logo/image using Framer Motion.

Would you like me to generate the full React component structure with actual code to get you started in Replit?
